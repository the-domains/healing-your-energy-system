## Energy System?  I didn't know I had one!

If you were born and raised in a Western culture it is not surprising that you know little about your own body's energy system.  The subject is not taught in schools and the fact that we have a very definite energy system is not recognized by conventional, allopathic medicine.

Yet other cultures have known and taught about our energy system since before European-American civilization began.  We have texts from China that map channels of the energy system that are more than two thousand years old!

Ancient literature from China, India and Tibet describe the structures and functions of various aspects of the energy system in colorful detail.

## What does the energy system do?

**The primary function of the energy system is to bring "life force" to every cell of your body.** The life force is mysterious energy that is called many names such as chi, ki, prana, and orgone.  It is mysterious because it is very difficult to detect and quantify with scientific instruments.  The prevailing attitude in Western science is that if you can't detect it and measure it, then it doesn't exist.  Yet the "life force" certainly exists.  You and all of the plants and animals on the planet wouldn't be here if it didn't.  Western scientists know it exists and they call it "subtle energy." 

For example, think of a carrot freshly pulled from the ground.  Maybe you have done this.  Break the carrot in half.  It snaps and you can smell it's unique fragrance.  Take a bite.  It's sweet and juicy.  Somehow you just know that it is going to be good for your body.

Now pull up another carrot.  Put it in the veggie drawer of your refrigerator and forget about for a couple weeks.  Now take it out and try to break it in half.  It bends like rubber, right?  Take a bite.  What happened to that juicy sweetness?  Now you find that it is dry and woody.   You throw it away because you somehow just know that it will do nothing for you.

So what is the difference between that freshly pulled carrot and the one that has been in the fridge for two weeks?  Answer: all the life force is gone.  The fresh carrot had been receiving life force from the four elements, earth, water, air, and fire (sunlight).  The two week old carrot from your fridge lost all of its life force and had no way to get more.  It was dead.

The differences between a healthy body, a sick body, and a dead body are the amounts of life force energy that are in the cells.

The body's energy system is complex and has many components.  Many people are now aware of the chakras (a Sanskrit word that means "wheel")  There are seven primary chakras, situated in the spine, and many secondary chakras.  Large amounts of life force energy enter these centers in spinning vortices.  These are the main entrance point for the life force into our bodies.

There is another system of energy distribution is known as the Nadi Network.  Some ancients texts from India state that there 72000 nadis.  Others report up to 350,000 of these channels!  Of these, there are three that are primary.  One goes up the middle of the spinal column and there is one that travels on each side of the spine.

The Meridian System and the Nadi Network don't have a physical manifestation.  No one can dissect a body and find them in the way that you can find blood vessels and nerves.  The channels themselves are made of subtle energy.  You might think of them more as currents of energy than as tubes that carry energy.

Western researchers attempting to understand how acupuncture works have found that connective tissues conduct both electrical energy and biophotons.  Yes, that's right, light particles actually circulate in some of the connective tissues.  This occurs in collagen fibers that have been found to be hollow.  In other words, the body has it's own fiber optic system!

Of particular interest are the fibrous membranes known as fascia that surround muscles.  You may have noticed this fascia when eating a chicken leg.  It is a very thin whitish covering over the muscle.  One of the reasons that massage therapy is so beneficial is that a good therapist will release fibrous adhesions in the fascia surrounding your muscles so that light and energy can circulate freely.

So we do indeed have an energy system and it's proper functioning is vital to our health.  Happily this fact is gaining more recognition in the general populace, resulting in more and more people seeking out health care practitioners who have expertise in caring for this vital aspect bodies.
